Results on all test data were a lot lower than validation set which led me to believe that there were errors during the data set up.
The models in here had nearly 98% accuracy on training and validation then performed around 50% on test. To prevent any more erros I am re importing the data, but will not make validation folder. I will use a validation set by with the datagenerator and flow from directory. I was able to try a few models with this and the validation and test results are more similar. 

All files within here have models and techniques that I will use as i move forward.
